# Address Editor for Umbraco

Goal: To have a configurable address editor that (amongst other things) is
capable of putting the zip code and city name editors in the same row :)

Also to be able to build a **Contact** property with **Name**, **Phone** and
**Email** fields on one document type, and to have another that holds
**Company Name**, **Address**, **Zip & City** for another document type.

All without having 3, 4, 5 or more generic *Textstring* fields on the doctype,
but to have a single property with the data. And not have to create a
convoluted *Nested Content/Archetype* setup for it either.
